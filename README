Zetalvx-Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-ChatBot-Example

Small tutorial example for setting up a chatbot with python using the LLama 3.1 8B model.

The bot can be started and used locally via console.
The bot has a function to save and load the previous history.
The code contains an initial prompt that can be used to assign a role and give some initial infoemations to the bot.

You can see the video where I demonstrate how it works on my YouTube channel:
